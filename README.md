Customer Churn means that a customer (player, subscriber, user, etc.) has terminated its relationship with a company. Online businesses often treat a customer as if they have churned after a certain amount of time since the customer's last interaction with the site or service. The full cost of loss includes both the loss of revenue and the marketing costs associated with replacing these customers. Reducing user churn is a core business goal of every online business. In this project, a classification model is created with the data we have now to predict the customers who may churn in the future. By using this model, it may be possible to identify the customers who are likely to churn in the future, reach them and offer opportunities or advantageous offers to prevent them from churning.
